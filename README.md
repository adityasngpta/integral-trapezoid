# integral-trapezoid
This project builds on the Integral Calculator by using trapezoids instead of rectangles to estimate the area beneath a curve. A trapezoid consists of a rectangle and a triangle on top. The base of the triangle is the width of the rectangle, and its height is the derivative of f(x) at the ith rectangle value times the width of the rectangle.
